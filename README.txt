Welcome to whoever may be reading this. This repository holds my software used to work with my project.

The software required Arduino IDE to run, so please download the full version. However, everything in
the code can be read if opened as a text file.

The is also a folder called libraries within this repository. Please download the files within that
folder into your Arduino libraries folder. If you download the entire libraries folder as a folder,
please only move the contents, as moving the folder called 'libraries' into 'libraries' will not allow
the code to run.

Inside this repository is also a copy of my dissertation in PDF format. I have kept a version here in
case that my submission does not corretly submit. If it did, please ignore this file.

Thank you for taking time to look over my work. I hope you have a good rest of your day. Thank you.

All the best,
